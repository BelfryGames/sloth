Scala LWJGL OpenGL Toolkit H...
===============================

This toolkit was created in order to help people work with OpenGL via LWJGL. The problem most people have is that
documentation like the OpenGL SuperBible book makes use of some helper libraries and it becomes quite complex
to follow the book without those.

In this toolkit we will attempt to provide a syntax as close as possible to the code in the book. That would
allow people to use it as they were working on C++.

We chose Scala because it is a much better language to work with than Java while taking full advantage of the JVM
as well as all the libraries and ecosystem.

"Sloth" was chosen as compared to Glut (Gluttony). Feel free to suggest a meaning for the H!
Another alternative was Slut: Scala Lwjgl Utility Toolkit :)
