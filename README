===============================
Scala LWJGL OpenGL Toolkit H...
===============================

This toolkit was created in order to help people work with OpenGL via LWJGL. The problem most people have is that
documentation like the OpenGL SuperBible book makes use of some helper libraries and it becomes quite complex
to follow the book without those.

In this toolkit we will attempt to provide a syntax as close as possible to the code in the book. That would
allow people to use it as they were working on C++.

We chose Scala because it is a much better language to work with than Java while taking full advantage of the JVM
as well as all the libraries and ecosystem.

"Sloth" was chosen as compared to Glut (Gluttony). Feel free to suggest a meaning for the H!
Another alternative was Scala Lwjgl Utility Toolkit... Slut! ;)

-------------------------------
Setup
-------------------------------

1. Checkout from GitHub
2. Until LWJGL is in the standard Maven respository we must install it locally
	a. Enter the lib/ folder and run mvn-lib-install.sh, or mvn-lib-install.sh if you are using Windows.
3. Run the pom with mvn install and se if it's working

The Release profile creates a complete .zip file ready to be run anywhere with a run.sh and run.bat files.

The default profile should be used while developing.

Sloth should actually be just a library to be included in a custom proyect, for now use this and add your own
code to it to test your OpenGL skills.
