/**
 * The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform open-source
 * C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms
 * for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform.
 * OpenGL core and extension functionality is exposed in a single header file.
 * GLEW has been tested on a variety of operating systems, including Windows,
 * Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Irix, and Solaris.
 *
 *
 * GLEW is a complete and absolute pain to figure out and implement.
 * If anyone feels like going for it you are most than welcome.
